- Support for all Kustomize patch types:
  - Strategic Merge Patches
  - JSON 6902 Patches
  - Regular patches
- Copy functionality for both input and output
- Clear output option
- Smooth scrolling and navigation
- Mobile-responsive design

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher

## Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kustomize-playground.git
cd kustomize-playground
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies using UV:
```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

4. Run the development server:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

## Docker Deployment

1. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t kustomize-playground .
```

2. Run the container:
```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 kustomize-playground
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

## Usage

1. Enter your Kubernetes resource YAML in the left editor
2. Enter your Kustomize patches in the right editor
3. Click "Apply Patches" to see the result
4. Use the copy buttons to copy the content of any editor
5. Use the clear button to reset the output
